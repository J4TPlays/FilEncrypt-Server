# FilEncrypt-Server
Encrypted chat server for anonymous messaging

Allows you to send completely encrypted messaages to other people.

This only allows you to encrypt ASCII, and anything that isn't ASCII either won't be read by the scripts or will crash your client.

## How to use the FilEncrypt Server (version 1.X ~ 2.X)
### Hosting
To host a server, you will need a portforwarded router if you wish to communicate with people on a different network. Simply run the script, type the word `host` and type the port you wish to use. As long as the port isn't in use, your server will work. It's that simple. Just ensure that if you do want to communicate with people on a different network, your router is portforwarded and your computer's firewall isn't blocking incoming and outgoing connections on that port. If people are unable to connect, this is most likely the issue.

### Connecting
To connect, you need to run two instances of the server script. This basically means that you need to open it twice.
To be able to read messages, pn one of the windows you must type the word `client`, and simply follow the instructions on screen. Once you are connected, you will get a notification telling you that you are connected.
To be able to send messages, on the other window you must type the word `messenger`, and simply follow the instructions on screen. Again, once you are connected you will get a notification telling you that you are connected to the server.

### Generating a key
To generate a key, you'll need to use the FilEncrypt scripts (available on the FilEncrypt repository)
